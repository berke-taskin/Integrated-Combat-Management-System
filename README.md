#Integrated Combat Management System
ICMS (Integrated Combat Management System): Integrates ARTAU and ECSU, coordinating threat detection
with environmental safety to determine if it is safe to engage a target.

ARTAU (Advanced Radar and Threat Assessment Unit): Detects and tracks targets using radar pulses,
calculates distance, and determines threats based on jet speed and safe distance thresholds.

ECSU (Environmental and Combat Support Unit): Monitors weather conditions like wind, visibility, and
temperature to assess flight safety and trigger emergency landing alerts if needed.
